# Exploratory Data Analysis Store Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a store dataset. The notebook includes steps for data loading, cleaning, and visualization to understand the underlying patterns and insights.

## Contents

1. **Introduction**
   - Understand the profit and sales across different departments as well different locations of the store.

2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**

3. **Data Inspection**
   - Check the dataset structure and features using `info()` and `describe()` methods.
   - Handle any missing values if present.

4. **Data Cleaning**
   - Select relevant features for analysis.
   - Handle missing values and ensure data types are appropriate.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Generate summary statistics of the dataset.
   - Visualize the data distributions and relationships between features using plots (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots, correlation heatmap).

6. **Insights and Findings**
   - Technology department have the most sales followed by furniture and office supplies.
